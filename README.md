This tutorial is a brief introduction to the Go language. The goals are as follows:

* Install and configure Go, the Glide package manager, and the Intellij Go plugin.
* Configure your Go development environment.
* Learn Go program layout, syntax, and features.
* Learn dependency management with a “real” application.

## Additional Resources

I recommend the following materials as a kick off point for additional learning:

* [The Go website](https://golang.org/)
* [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/) - A quick walkthrough of the Go language.
* [Go command usage](https://golang.org/cmd/go/) - How to use the go CLI tool.
* [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) - A slightly more thorough walkthrough of the Go language.
* [The Go Programming Language Specification](https://golang.org/ref/spec) - It’s not as daunting as it sounds (82 pages). That would be the Java Language Specification(Java SE 8 - 788 pages).

* [Go Bootcamp](http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book/) - An online book, exercises included.
